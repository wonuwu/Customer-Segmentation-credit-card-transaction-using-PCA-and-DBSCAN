# Customer-Segmentation-credit-card-transaction-using-PCA-and-DBSCAN

Customer segmentation helps in enabling companies to identify patterns and behaviors within their customer base. This repository outlines my significant contribution to the project, which involved the implementation of the DBSCAN clustering algorithm in conjunction with PCA for dimensionality reduction.

The dataset utilized is the "CC General" dataset, a comprehensive collection of credit card transaction records of customers in a mall setting. It encompasses data from 8,950 customer card accounts alongside 23 features, making it a substantial source for exploring customer behavior and segmentation. The dataset was taken from Kaggle, a  well-known online platform for the data science community and is stored with more than thousands of datasets.  

The integration of DBSCAN and PCA yielded promising results. Our approach successfully segmented customers into distinct clusters based on their transaction behavior, shedding light on different spending patterns and preferences within our dataset. The visualization of these clusters using PCA reduced the data to a manageable number of dimensions while preserving significant variance. This approach offered an effective means of uncovering meaningful customer segments within the credit card transaction dataset for both unfixed and fixed number of clusters.
